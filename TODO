Todo (EVM):
    ✔ make VMResultStrings in evm a map @done(21-10-25 00:14)
    ✔ instead of using results...use exception throwing @done(21-10-25 03:30)
    ☐ write tests for evm parsing errors

    ☐ asserts
    ☐ exceptions
    ☐ access operator
    ☐ functions: `def myfunc = function (arg1:int, arg2:int) -> bool { ... }`
    ☐ while statement
      ☐ `loop {}` will be syntax sugar for `while True { }`
    ☐ for loop
    ☐ loop: `loop x { }` loops the code block x times; not syntatic sugar because one can change x in the loop but the loop still loops the original x times
    ☐ match stmts and exprs
